"""
Purpose: Look assertion
                = Positive
                ! Negative

        1) Positive Lookahead   (?=pattern)
            - Matches if the pattern inside the lookahead assertion is present ahead.
            - Ex: apple(?= pie) matches "apple" only if it is followed by the word "pie".

        2) Negative Lookahead   (?!pattern)
            - Matches if the pattern inside the lookahead assertion is not present ahead.
            - Ex: apple(?! pie) matches "apple" only if it is not followed by the word "pie".

        3) Positive Lookbehind   (?<=pattern)
            - Matches if the pattern inside the lookbehind assertion is present behind.
            - Ex: (?<=good )morning matches "morning" only if it is preceded by the word "good".

        4) Negative Lookbehind   (?<=pattern)
            - Matches if the pattern inside the lookbehind assertion is not present behind.
            - Ex: (?<!not )good morning matches "good morning" only if it is not preceded by the word "not".

"""
Purpose: StringIO Module
    - Implements an in-memory file like object.
    - This object can then be used as input or
      output to most functions that would expect
      a standard file object.

cStringIO is c based implementation for StringIO,
which is faster.

In Python 3, these both modules are replaced with io module

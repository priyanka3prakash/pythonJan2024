"""
Purpose: Python program to check if the input number is prime or not

    A positive integer greater than 1 which has no other factors except 1 and
    the number itself is called a prime number. 2, 3, 5, 7 etc. are prime numbers
    as they do not have any other factors.
    But 6 is not prime (it is composite) since, 2 x 3 = 6.

    2,  3, 5, 7, 11, ...
